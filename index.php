            I could say I never dare <br>
            To think about you in that way, but<br>
            I would be lyin'<br>
            And I pretend I'm happy for you<br>
            When you find some dude to take home<br>
            But I won't deny that<br>
            In the midst of the crowds<br>
            In the shapes in the clouds<br>
            I don't see nobody but you<br>
            In my rose-tinted dreams<br>
            Wrinkled silk on my sheets<br>
            I don't see nobody but you<br>
            Boy, you got me hooked onto something<br>
            Who could say that they saw us coming?<br>
            Tell me<br>
            Do you feel the love?<br>
            Spend a summer or a lifetime with me<br>
            Let me take you to the place of your dreams<br>
            Tell me<br>
            Do you feel the love?<br>
            And I could say I never unzipped<br>
            Those blue Levi's inside my head<br>
            But that's far from the truth<br>
            Don't know what's come over me<br>
            It seems like yesterday when I said<br>
            "We'll be friends forever"<br>
            Constellations of stars<br>
            Murals on city walls<br>
            I don't see nobody but you<br>
            You're my vice, you're my muse<br>
            You're a nineteenth floor view<br>
            I don't see nobody but you<br>
            Boy, you got me hooked onto something<br>
            Who could say that they saw us coming?<br>
            Tell me<br>
            Do you feel the love?<br>
            Spend a summer or a lifetime with me<br>
            Let me take you to the place of your dreams<br>
            Tell me<br>
            Do you feel the love?<br>
